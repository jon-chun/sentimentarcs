0,marley own ghost
1,marley was dead to begin with
2,there is no doubt whatever about that
3,the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner
4,scrooge signed it and scrooge own name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to
5,old marley was as dead as a door nail
6,mind
7,i do not mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a door nail
8,i might have been inclined myself to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade
9,but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the country own done for
10,you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a door nail
11,scrooge knew he was dead
12,of course he did
13,how could it be otherwise
14,scrooge and he were partners for i do not know how many years
15,scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner
16,and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain
17,the mention of marley own funeral brings me back to the point i started from
18,there is no doubt that marley was dead
19,this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate
20,if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlet own father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other middle aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot say saint paul own churchyard for instance literally to astonish his son own weak mind
21,scrooge never painted out old marley own name
22,there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley
23,the firm was known as scrooge and marley
24,sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names
25,it was all the same to him
26,but he was a tight fisted hand at the grind stone scrooge a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner
27,hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and self contained and solitary as an oyster
28,the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice
29,a frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin
30,he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the dog days and did not thaw it one degree at christmas
31,external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge
32,no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him
33,no wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty
34,foul weather did not know where to have him
35,the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect
36,they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did
37,nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me
38,no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was of the clock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge
39,even the blind men own dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master
40,but what did scrooge care
41,it was the very thing he liked
42,to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge
43,once upon a time of all the good days in the year on christmas eve old scrooge sat busy in his counting house
44,it was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them
45,the city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark already it had not been light all day and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air
46,the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms
47,to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale
48,the door of scrooge own counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters
49,scrooge had a very small fire but the clerk own fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal
50,but he could not replenish it for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part
51,wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being a man of a strong imagination he failed
52,a merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice
53,it was the voice of scrooge own nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach
54,bah said scrooge humbug
55,he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooge own that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again
56,christmas a humbug uncle said scrooge own nephew
57,you do not mean that i am sure
58,i do said scrooge
59,merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry you are poor enough
60,come then returned the nephew gaily
61,what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose you are rich enough
62,scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah again and followed it up with humbug
63,do not be cross uncle said the nephew
64,what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what is christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in them through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart he should
65,uncle pleaded the nephew
66,nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine
67,keep it repeated scrooge own nephew
68,but you do not keep it
69,let me leave it alone then said scrooge
70,much good may it do you much good it has ever done you
71,there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say returned the nephew
72,christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come round apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from that as a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it
73,the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded
74,becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever
75,let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and you keep your christmas by losing your situation you are quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew
76,i wonder you do not go into parliament
77,do not be angry uncle come dine with us to morrow
78,scrooge said that he would see him yes indeed he did
79,he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first
80,but why cried scrooge own nephew
81,why
82,why did you get married said scrooge
83,because i fell in love
84,because you fell in love growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas
85,good afternoon
86,nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened why give it as a reason for not coming now
87,good afternoon said scrooge
88,i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why cannot we be friends
89,good afternoon said scrooge
90,i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and i keep my christmas humour to the last so a merry christmas uncle
91,good afternoon said scrooge
92,and a happy new year
93,good afternoon said scrooge
94,his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding
95,he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially
96,there is another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas i retire to bedlam
97,this lunatic in letting scrooge own nephew out had let two other people in
98,they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge own office
99,they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him
100,scrooge and marley own i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list
101,have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley
102,mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied
103,he died seven years ago this very night
104,we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials
105,it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits
106,at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back
107,at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir
108,are there no prisons asked scrooge
109,plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again
110,and the union workhouses demanded scrooge
111,are they still in operation
112,they are still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were not
113,the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge
114,both very busy sir
115,oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge
116,i very glad to hear it
117,under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for
118,nothing
119,scrooge replied
120,you wish to be anonymous
121,i wish to be left alone said scrooge
122,since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i do not make merry myself at christmas and i cannot afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentioned they cost enough and those who are badly off must go there
123,many cannot go there and many would rather die
124,if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population besides excuse me i do not know that
125,but you might know it observed the gentleman
126,it is not my business scrooge returned
127,it is enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people own mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen
128,seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew
129,scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him
130,meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way
131,the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there
132,the cold became intense
133,in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the gas pipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture
134,the water plug being left in solitude its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice
135,the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed
136,poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do
137,the lord mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayor own household should and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on the previous monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets stirred up to morrow own pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef
138,foggier yet and colder
139,piercing searching biting cold
140,if the good saint dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit own nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose
141,the owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at scrooge own keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol but at the first sound of
142,god bless you merry gentleman may nothing you dismay
143,scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost
144,at length the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived
145,with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat
146,you want all day to morrow i suppose said scrooge
147,if quite convenient sir
148,it is not convenient said scrooge and it is not fair if i was to stop half a crown for it you would think yourself ill used i be bound
149,the clerk smiled faintly
150,and yet said scrooge you do not think me ill used when i pay a day own wages for no work
151,the clerk observed that it was only once a year
152,a poor excuse for picking a man own pocket every twenty fifth of december said scrooge buttoning his great coat to the chin
153,but i suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier next morning
154,the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl
155,the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist for he boasted no great coat went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blindman own buff
156,scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker own book went home to bed
157,he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner
158,they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at hide and seek with other houses and forgotten the way out again
159,it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices
160,the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands
161,the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold
162,now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large
163,it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of london even including which is a bold word the corporation aldermen and livery
164,let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon
165,and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not a knocker but marley own face
166,marley own face
167,it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar
168,it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead
169,the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless
170,that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression
171,as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again
172,to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue
173,but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle
174,he did pause with a moment own irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marley own pigtail sticking out into the hall
175,but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with a bang
176,the sound resounded through the house like thunder
177,every room above and every cask in the wine merchant own cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own
178,scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes
179,he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went
180,you may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the splinter bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy
181,there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom
182,half a dozen gas lamps out of the street would not have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge own dip
183,up scrooge went not caring a button for that
184,darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it
185,but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right
186,he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that
187,sitting room bedroom lumber room
188,all as they should be
189,nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob
190,nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressing gown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall
191,lumber room as usual
192,old fire guard old shoes two fish baskets washing stand on three legs and a poker
193,quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in double locked himself in which was not his custom
194,thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressing gown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel
195,it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night
196,he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel
197,the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures
198,there were cains and abels pharaoh own daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butter boats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophet own rod and swallowed up the whole
199,if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marley own head on every one
200,humbug said scrooge and walked across the room
201,after several turns he sat down again
202,as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building
203,it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing
204,it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house
205,this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour
206,the bells ceased as they had begun together
207,they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant own cellar
208,scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains
209,the cellar door flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door
210,it is humbug still said scrooge
211,i will not believe it
212,his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes
213,upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him marley own ghost and fell again
214,the same face the very same
215,marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coat skirts and the hair upon his head
216,the chain he drew was clasped about his middle
217,it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cash boxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel
218,his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind
219,scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now
220,no nor did he believe it even now
221,though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling influence of its death cold eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his senses
222,how now said scrooge caustic and cold as ever
223,what do you want with me
224,much marley own voice no doubt about it
225,who are you
226,ask me who i was
227,who were you then said scrooge raising his voice
228,you are particular for a shade
229,he was going to say to a shade but substituted this as more appropriate
230,in life i was your partner jacob marley
231,can you can you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him
232,i can
233,do it then
234,scrooge asked the question because he did not know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation
235,but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it
236,you do not believe in me observed the ghost
237,i do not said scrooge
238,what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses
239,i do not know said scrooge
240,why do you doubt your senses
241,because said scrooge a little thing affects them a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato there is more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are
242,scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then
243,the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectre own voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones
244,to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him
245,there was something very awful too in the spectre own being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own
246,scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven
247,you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the vision own stony gaze from himself
248,i do replied the ghost
249,you are not looking at it said scrooge
250,but i see it said the ghost notwithstanding
251,well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug
252,at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon
253,but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast
254,scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face
255,mercy he said
256,dreadful apparition why do you trouble me
257,man of the worldly mind replied the ghost do you believe in me or not
258,i do said scrooge
259,i must but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me
260,it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death it is doomed to wander through the world oh woe is me and witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness
261,again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands
262,you are fettered said scrooge trembling
263,tell me why
264,i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost
265,i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is its pattern strange to you
266,scrooge trembled more and more
267,or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is a ponderous chain
268,scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing
269,jacob he said imploringly
270,old jacob marley tell me more speak comfort to me jacob
271,i have none to give the ghost replied
272,it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men nor can i tell you what i would a very little more is all permitted to me i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere my spirit never walked beyond our counting house mark me in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hole and weary journeys lie before me
273,it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets
274,pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees
275,you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a business like manner though with humility and deference
276,slow the ghost repeated
277,seven years dead mused scrooge
278,and travelling all the time
279,the whole time said the ghost
280,no rest no peace incessant torture of remorse
281,you travel fast said scrooge
282,on the wings of the wind replied the ghost
283,you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge
284,the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance
285,oh captive bound and double ironed cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life own opportunity misused yet such was i oh such was i
286,but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself
287,business cried the ghost wringing its hands again
288,mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business
289,it held up its chain at arm own length as if that were the because of all its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again
290,at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me
291,scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly
292,hear me cried the ghost
293,my time is nearly gone
294,i will said scrooge
295,but do not be hard upon me do not be flowery jacob pray
296,how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see i may not tell i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day
297,it was not an agreeable idea
298,scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow
299,that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost
300,i am here to night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate a chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer
301,you were always a good friend to me said scrooge
302,thankee
303,you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three spirits
304,scrooge own countenance fell almost as low as the ghost own had done
305,is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob he demanded in a faltering voice
306,it is
307,i i think I would rather not said scrooge
308,without their visits said the ghost you cannot hope to shun the path i tread expect the first to morrow when the bell tolls one
309,could not i take them all at once and have it over jacob hinted scrooge
310,expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us
311,when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before
312,scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage
313,he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm
314,the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open
315,it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did
316,when they were within two paces of each other marley own ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer
317,scrooge stopped
318,not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self accusatory
319,the spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night
320,scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity
321,he looked out
322,the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went
323,every one of them wore chains like marley own ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free
324,many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives
325,he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a door step
326,the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever
327,whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell
328,but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been when he walked home
329,scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered
330,it was double locked as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed
331,he tried to say humbug but stopped at the first syllable
332,and being from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant
333,the first of the three spirits
334,when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber
335,he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters
336,so he listened for the hour
337,to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped
338,twelve
339,it was past two when he went to bed
340,the clock was wrong
341,an icicle must have got into the works
342,twelve
343,he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock
344,its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped
345,why it is not possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night it is not possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon
346,the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window
347,he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he could see anything and could see very little then
348,all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world
349,this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by
350,scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it
351,the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought
352,marley own ghost bothered him exceedingly
353,every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not
354,scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one
355,he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power
356,the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock
357,at length it broke upon his listening ear
358,ding dong
359,a quarter past said scrooge counting
360,ding dong
361,half past said scrooge
362,ding dong
363,a quarter to it said scrooge
364,ding dong
365,the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else
366,he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one
367,light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn
368,the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand
369,not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed
370,the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a half recumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow
371,it was a strange figure like a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a child own proportions
372,its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin
373,the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength
374,its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare
375,it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful
376,it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers
377,but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm
378,even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality
379,for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away
380,and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever
381,are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me asked scrooge
382,i am
383,the voice was soft and gentle
384,singularly low as if instead of being so close beside him it were at a distance
385,who and what are you
386,scrooge demanded
387,i am the ghost of christmas past
388,long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature
389,no your past
390,perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered
391,what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow
392,scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life
393,he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there
394,your welfare said the ghost
395,scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end
396,the spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately
397,your reclamation then take heed
398,it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm
399,rise and walk with me
400,it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressing gown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time
401,the grasp though gentle as a woman own hand was not to be resisted
402,he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication
403,i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall
404,bear but a touch of my hand there said the spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this
405,as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand
406,the city had entirely vanished
407,not a vestige of it was to be seen
408,the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground
409,good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him
410,i was bred in this place i was a boy here
411,the spirit gazed upon him mildly
412,its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man own sense of feeling
413,he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten
414,your lip is trembling said the ghost
415,and what is that upon your cheek
416,scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would
417,you recollect the way inquired the spirit
418,remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold
419,strange to have forgotten it for so many years observed the ghost
420,let us go on
421,they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little market town appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river
422,some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers
423,all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it
424,these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost
425,they have no consciousness of us
426,the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one
427,why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them
428,why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past
429,why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at cross roads and bye ways for their several homes
430,what was merry christmas to scrooge
431,out upon merry christmas
432,what good had it ever done to him
433,the school is not quite deserted said the ghost
434,a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still
435,scrooge said he knew it
436,and he sobbed
437,they left the high road by a well remembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercock surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it
438,it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed
439,fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coach houses and sheds were over run with grass
440,nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast
441,there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light and not too much to eat
442,they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house
443,it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks
444,at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be
445,not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the half thawed water spout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty store house door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears
446,the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading
447,suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood
448,why it is ali baba
449,scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy
450,it is dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and what is his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus do not you see him and the sultan own groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess
451,to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed
452,there is the parrot cried scrooge
453,green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe the man thought he was dreaming but he was not it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo
454,then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self poor boy and cried again
455,i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but it is too late now
456,what is the matter asked the spirit
457,nothing said scrooge
458,nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that is all
459,the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so let us see another christmas
460,scrooge own former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty
461,the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do
462,he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays
463,he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly
464,scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door
465,it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear brother
466,i have come to bring you home dear brother said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh
467,to bring you home home home
468,home little fan returned the boy
469,yes said the child brimful of glee
470,home for good and all home for ever and ever father is so much kinder than he used to be that home own like heaven he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you and you are to be a man said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but first we are to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world
471,you are quite a woman little fan exclaimed the boy
472,she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him
473,then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loth to go accompanied her
474,a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooge own box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him
475,he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold
476,here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not
477,master scrooge own trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster good bye right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the garden sweep the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray
478,always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered said the ghost
479,but she had a large heart
480,so she had cried scrooge
481,you are right i will not gainsay it spirit god forbid
482,she died a woman said the ghost and had as i think children
483,one child scrooge returned
484,true said the ghost
485,your nephew
486,scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes
487,although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed and repassed where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and tumult of a real city were
488,it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up
489,the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it
490,know it said scrooge
491,was i apprenticed here
492,they went in
493,at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement
494,why it is old fezziwig bless his heart it is fezziwig alive again
495,old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven
496,he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice
497,yo ho there ebenezer dick
498,scrooge own former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow prentice
499,dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost
500,bless me yes there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear
501,yo ho my boys said fezziwig
502,no more work to night christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer let us have the shutters up cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack robinson
503,you would not believe how those two fellows went at it
504,they charged into the street with the shutters one two three had them up in their places four five six barred them and pinned them seven eight nine and came back before you could have got to twelve panting like race horses
505,hilli ho cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility
506,clear away my lads and let us have lots of room here hilli ho dick chirrup ebenezer
507,clear away
508,there was nothing they would not have cleared away or could not have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on
509,it was done in a minute
510,every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ball room as you would desire to see upon a winter own night
511,in came a fiddler with a music book and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomach aches
512,in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile
513,in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable
514,in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke
515,in came all the young men and women employed in the business
516,in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker
517,in came the cook with her brother own particular friend the milkman
518,in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress
519,in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow
520,away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them
521,when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose
522,but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a bran new man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish
523,there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mince pies and plenty of beer
524,but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him struck up sir roger de coverley
525,then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig
526,top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking
527,but if they had been twice as many ah four times old fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig
528,as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term
529,if that is not high praise tell me higher and i use it
530,a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig own calves
531,they shone in every part of the dance like moons
532,you could not have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next
533,and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew thread the needle and back again to your place fezziwig cut cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger
534,when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up
535,mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas
536,when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the back shop
537,during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits
538,his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self
539,he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation
540,it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear
541,a small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of gratitude
542,small echoed scrooge
543,the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said
544,why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise
545,it is not that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self
546,it is not that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count them up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune
547,he felt the spirit own glance and stopped
548,what is the matter asked the ghost
549,nothing particular said scrooge
550,something i think the ghost insisted
551,no said scrooge no i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now that is all
552,his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air
553,my time grows short observed the spirit
554,quick
555,this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect
556,for again scrooge saw himself
557,he was older now a man in the prime of life
558,his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice
559,there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall
560,he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past
561,it matters little she said softly
562,to you very little another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have no just because to grieve
563,what idol has displaced you he rejoined
564,a golden one
565,this is the even handed dealing of the world he said
566,there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth
567,you fear the world too much she answered gently
568,all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the master passion gain engrosses you have i not
569,what then he retorted
570,even if i have grown so much wiser what then i am not changed towards you
571,she shook her head
572,am i
573,our contract is an old one it was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry you are changed when it was made you were another man
574,i was a boy he said impatiently
575,your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she returned
576,i am that which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two how often and how keenly i have thought of this i will not say it is enough that i have thought of it and can release you
577,have i ever sought release
578,in words no never
579,in what then
580,in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight if this had never been between us said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now ah no
581,he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself
582,but he said with a struggle you think not
583,i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered heaven knows when i have learned a truth like this i know how strong and irresistible it must be but if you were free to day to morrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girl you who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow i do and i release you with a full heart for the love of him you once were
584,he was about to speak but with her head turned from him she resumed
585,you may the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will have pain in this a very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke may you be happy in the life you have chosen
586,she left him and they parted
587,spirit said scrooge show me no more conduct me home why do you delight to torture me
588,one shadow more exclaimed the ghost
589,no more cried scrooge
590,no more i do not wish to see it show me no more
591,but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next
592,they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort
593,near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter
594,the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty
595,the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly
596,what would i not have given to be one of them
597,though i never could have been so rude no no
598,i would not for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i would not have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life
599,as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i could not have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again
600,and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value
601,but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents
602,then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter
603,the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of brown paper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection
604,the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received
605,the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll own frying pan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter
606,the immense relief of finding this a false alarm
607,the joy and gratitude and ecstasy
608,they are all indescribable alike
609,it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided
610,and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a spring time in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed
611,belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon
612,who was it
613,guess
614,how can i tut do not i know she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed
615,mr scrooge
616,mr scrooge it was i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone quite alone in the world i do believe
617,spirit said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place
618,i told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the ghost
619,that they are what they are do not blame me
620,remove me
621,scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it
622,he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it
623,leave me take me back haunt me no longer
624,in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguisher cap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head
625,the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground
626,he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom
627,he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep
628,the second of the three spirits
629,awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one
630,he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marley own intervention
631,but finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying down again established a sharp look out all round the bed
632,for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous
633,gentlemen of the free and easy sort who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two and being usually equal to the time of day express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch and toss to manslaughter between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects
634,without venturing for scrooge quite as hardily as this i do not mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much
635,now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means prepared for nothing and consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling
636,five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came
637,all this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour and which being only light was more alarming than a dozen ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it
638,at last however he began to think as you or i would have thought at first for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably have done it too at last i say he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine
639,this idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door
640,the moment scrooge own hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name and bade him enter
641,he obeyed
642,it was his own room
643,there was no doubt about that
644,but it had undergone a surprising transformation
645,the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened
646,the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooge own time or marley own or for many and many a winter season gone
647,heaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry brawn great joints of meat sucking pigs long wreaths of sausages mince pies plum puddings barrels of oysters red hot chestnuts cherry cheeked apples juicy oranges luscious pears immense twelfth cakes and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam
648,in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plenty own horn and held it up high up to she would its light on scrooge as he came peeping round the door
649,come in exclaimed the ghost
650,come in and know me better man
651,scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit
652,he was not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirit own eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them
653,i am the ghost of christmas present said the spirit
654,look upon me
655,scrooge reverently did so
656,it was clothed in one simple green robe or mantle bordered with white fur
657,this garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice
658,its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were also bare and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining icicles
659,its dark brown curls were long and free free as its genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air
660,girded round its middle was an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust
661,you have never seen the like of me before exclaimed the spirit
662,never scrooge made answer to it
663,have never walked forth with the younger members of my family meaning for i am very young my elder brothers born in these later years pursued the phantom
664,i do not think i have said scrooge
665,i am afraid i have not have you had many brothers spirit
666,more than eighteen hundred said the ghost
667,a tremendous family to provide for muttered scrooge
668,the ghost of christmas present rose
669,spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will i went forth last night on compulsion and i learnt a lesson which is working now to night if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it
670,touch my robe
671,scrooge did as he was told and held it fast
672,holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly
673,so did the room the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning where for the weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial little snow storms
674,the house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows that crossed and re crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water
675,the sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms as if all the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their dear hearts content
676,there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain
677,for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball better natured missile far than many a wordy jest laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong
678,the poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory
679,there were great round pot bellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence
680,there were ruddy brown faced broad girthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hung up mistletoe
681,there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people own mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner
682,the very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and stagnant blooded race appeared to know that there was something going on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement
683,the grocers oh the grocers nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses
684,it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers on feel faint and subsequently bilious
685,nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly decorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose
686,but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces
687,and at the same time there emerged from scores of bye streets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops
688,the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a baker own doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch
689,and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner carriers who had jostled each other he she would a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly
690,for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day
691,and so it was
692,god love it so it was
693,in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker own oven where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too
694,is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch asked scrooge
695,there is my own
696,would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day asked scrooge
697,to any kindly given to a poor one most
698,why to a poor one most asked scrooge
699,because it needs it most
700,spirit said scrooge after a moment own thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these people own opportunities of innocent enjoyment
701,i cried the spirit
702,you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said scrooge
703,would not you
704,i cried the spirit
705,you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge
706,and it comes to the same thing
707,i seek exclaimed the spirit
708,forgive me if i am wrong it has been done in your name or at least in that of your family said scrooge
709,there are some upon this earth of yours returned the spirit who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride ill will hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us
710,scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town
711,it was a remarkable quality of the ghost which scrooge had observed at the baker own that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall
712,and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooge own clerk own for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchit own dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch
713,think of that
714,bob had but fifteen bob a week himself he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his four roomed house
715,then up rose mrs cratchit cratchit own wife dressed out but poorly in a twice turned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar bob own private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks
716,and now two smaller cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the baker own they had smelt the goose and known it for their own and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he not proud although his collars nearly choked him blew the fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepan lid to be let out and peeled
717,what has ever got your precious father then said mrs cratchit
718,and your brother tiny tim and martha warnt as late last christmas day by half an hour
719,here is martha mother said a girl appearing as she spoke
720,here is martha mother cried the two young cratchits
721,hurrah there is such a goose martha
722,why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are said mrs cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal
723,we would a deal of work to finish up last night replied the girl and had to clear away this morning mother
724,well never mind so long as you are come said mrs cratchit
725,sit ye down before the fire my dear and have a warm lord bless ye
726,no no there is father coming cried the two young cratchits who were everywhere at once
727,hide martha hide
728,so martha hid herself and in came little bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable and tiny tim upon his shoulder
729,alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame
730,why where is our martha cried bob cratchit looking round
731,not coming said mrs cratchit
732,not coming said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits for he had been tim own blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant
733,not coming upon christmas day
734,martha did not like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the wash house that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper
735,and how did little tim behave asked mrs cratchit when she had rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his heart own content
736,as good as gold said bob and better somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see
737,bob own voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty
738,his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire and while bob turning up his cuffs as if poor fellow they were capable of being made more shabby compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession
739,such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds a feathered phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of course and in truth it was something very like it in that house
740,mrs cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss belinda sweetened up the apple sauce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped
741,at last the dishes were set on and grace was said
742,it was succeeded by a breathless pause as mrs cratchit looking slowly all along the carving knife prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried hurrah
743,there never was such a goose
744,bob said he did not believe there ever was such a goose cooked
745,its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration
746,eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family indeed as mrs cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish they had not ate it all at last
747,yet every one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows
748,but now the plates being changed by miss belinda mrs cratchit left the room alone too nervous to bear witnesses to take the pudding up and bring it in
749,suppose it should not be done enough
750,suppose it should break in turning out
751,suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back yard and stolen it while they were merry with the goose a supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid
752,all sorts of horrors were supposed
753,hallo
754,a great deal of steam
755,the pudding was out of the copper
756,a smell like a washing day
757,that was the cloth
758,a smell like an eating house and a pastrycook own next door to each other with a laundress own next door to that
759,that was the pudding
760,in half a minute mrs cratchit entered flushed but smiling proudly with the pudding like a speckled cannon ball so hard and firm blazing in half of half a quartern of ignited brandy and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top
761,oh a wonderful pudding
762,bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since their marriage
763,mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour
764,everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family
765,it would have been flat heresy to do so
766,any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing
767,at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up
768,the compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire
769,then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half a one and at bob cratchit own elbow stood the family display of glass
770,two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle
771,these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily
772,then bob proposed
773,a merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us
774,which all the family re echoed
775,god bless us every one said tiny tim the last of all
776,he sat very close to his father own side upon his little stool
777,bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him
778,spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell me if tiny tim will live
779,i see a vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor chimney corner and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die
780,no no said scrooge
781,oh no kind spirit say he will be spared
782,if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race returned the ghost will find him here what then if he be like to die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population
783,scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief
784,man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cannot until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man own child oh god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust
785,scrooge bent before the ghost own rebuke and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground
786,but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name
787,mr scrooge said bob i give you mr scrooge the founder of the feast
788,the founder of the feast indeed cried mrs cratchit reddening
789,i wish i had him here I would give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and i hope he would have a good appetite for it
790,my dear said bob the children christmas day
791,it should be christmas day i am sure said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as mr scrooge you know he is robert nobody knows it better than you do poor fellow
792,my dear was bob own mild answer christmas day
793,i drink his health for your sake and the day own said mrs cratchit not for his long life to him a merry christmas and a happy new year he be very merry and very happy i have no doubt
794,the children drank the toast after her
795,it was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness
796,tiny tim drank it last of all but he did not care twopence for it
797,scrooge was the ogre of the family
798,the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled for full five minutes
799,after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with
800,bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter which would bring in if obtained full five and sixpence weekly
801,the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peter own being a man of business and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income
802,martha who was a poor apprentice at a milliner own then told them what kind of work she had to do and how many hours she worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to morrow morning for a good long rest to morrow being a holiday she passed at home
803,also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before and how the lord was much about as tall as peter at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you could not have seen his head if you had been there
804,all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and by and bye they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from tiny tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed
805,there was nothing of high mark in this
806,they were not a handsome family they were not well dressed their shoes were far from being water proof their clothes were scanty and peter might have known and very likely did the inside of a pawnbroker own
807,but they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirit own torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny tim until the last
808,by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful
809,here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness
810,there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them
811,here again were shadows on the window blind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and fur booted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbour own house where woe upon the single man who saw them enter artful witches well they knew it in a glow
812,but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires half chimney high
813,blessings on it how the ghost exulted
814,how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach
815,the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas
816,and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burial place of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass
817,down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night
818,what place is this asked scrooge
819,a place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth returned the spirit
820,but they know me see
821,a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it
822,passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire
823,an old old man and woman with their children and their children own children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire
824,the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas song it had been a very old song when he was a boy and from time to time they all joined in the chorus
825,so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again
826,the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor sped whither
827,not to sea
828,to sea
829,to scrooge own horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth
830,built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse
831,great heaps of sea weed clung to its base and storm birds born of the wind one might suppose as sea weed of the water rose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed
832,but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall she would out a ray of brightness on the awful sea
833,joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figure head of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself
834,again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea on on until being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship
835,they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the look out in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it
836,and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him
837,it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh
838,it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew own and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability
839,ha ha laughed scrooge own nephew
840,ha ha ha
841,if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooge own nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too
842,introduce him to me and i cultivate his acquaintance
843,it is a fair even handed noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour
844,when scrooge own nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooge own niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he
845,and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily
846,ha ha ha ha ha ha
847,he said that christmas was a humbug as i live cried scrooge own nephew
848,he believed it too
849,more shame for him fred said scrooge own niece indignantly
850,bless those women they never do anything by halves
851,they are always in earnest
852,she was very pretty exceedingly pretty
853,with a dimpled surprised looking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissed as no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature own head
854,altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too
855,oh perfectly satisfactory
856,he is a comical old fellow said scrooge own nephew that is the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him
857,i sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooge own niece
858,at least you always tell me so
859,what of that my dear said scrooge own nephew
860,his wealth is of no use to him he do not do any good with it he do not make himself comfortable with it he has not the satisfaction of thinking ha ha ha that he is ever going to benefit us with it
861,i have no patience with him observed scrooge own niece
862,scrooge own niece own sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion
863,oh i have said scrooge own nephew
864,i am sorry for him i could not be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he will not come and dine with us what is the consequence he do not lose much of a dinner
865,indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooge own niece
866,everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight
867,well i very glad to hear it said scrooge own nephew because i have not great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say topper
868,topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge own niece own sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject
869,whereat scrooge own niece own sister the plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the roses blushed
870,do go on fred said scrooge own niece clapping her hands
871,he never finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow
872,scrooge own nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed
873,i was only going to say said scrooge own nephew that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cannot help thinking better of it i defy him if he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds that is something and i think i shook him yesterday
874,it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge
875,but being thoroughly good natured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously
876,after tea they had some music
877,for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it
878,scrooge own niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boarding school as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past
879,when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sexton own spade that buried jacob marley
880,but they did not devote the whole evening to music
881,after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself
882,stop
883,there was first a game at blind man own buff
884,of course there was
885,and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots
886,my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooge own nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it
887,the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature
888,knocking down the fire irons tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he
889,he always knew where the plump sister was
890,he would not catch anybody else
891,if you had fallen up against him as some of them did on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister
892,she often cried out that it was not fair and it really was not
893,but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable
894,for his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head dress and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous
895,no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blind man being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains
896,scrooge own niece was not one of the blind man own buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her
897,but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet
898,likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooge own nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you
899,there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be
900,the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed
901,but this the spirit said could not be done
902,here is a new game said scrooge
903,one half hour spirit only one
904,it was a game called yes and no where scrooge own nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was
905,the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and was not made a show of and was not led by anybody and did not live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear
906,at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp
907,at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out
908,i have found it out i know what it is fred i know what it is
909,what is it cried fred
910,it is your uncle scro o o o oge
911,which it certainly was
912,admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it a bear ought to have been yes inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way
913,he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge
914,well uncle scrooge they cried
915,a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is said scrooge own nephew
916,he would not take it from me but may he have it nevertheless uncle scrooge
917,uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time
918,but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels
919,much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with a happy end
920,the spirit stood beside sick beds and they were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by struggling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty and it was rich
921,in almshouse hospital and jail in misery own every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught scrooge his precepts
922,it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together
923,it was strange too that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older
924,scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a children own twelfth night party when looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey
925,are spirits lives so short asked scrooge
926,my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost
927,it ends to night
928,to night cried scrooge
929,to night at midnight hark the time is drawing near
930,the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment
931,forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirit own robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts is it a foot or a claw
932,it might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it was the spirit own sorrowful reply
933,look here
934,from the foldings of its robe it brought two children wretched abject frightful hideous miserable
935,they knelt down at its feet and clung upon the outside of its garment
936,oh man look here look look down here exclaimed the ghost
937,they were a boy and girl
938,yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but prostrate too in their humility
939,where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints a stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled them into shreds
940,where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing
941,no change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread
942,scrooge started back appalled
943,having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude
944,spirit are they yours
945,scrooge could say no more
946,they are man own said the spirit looking down upon them
947,and they cling to me appealing from their fathers this boy is ignorance this girl is want beware them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased deny it cried the spirit stretching out its hand towards the city
948,slander those who tell it ye admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse and bide the end
949,have they no refuge or resource cried scrooge
950,are there no prisons said the spirit turning on him for the last time with his own words
951,are there no workhouses
952,the bell struck twelve
953,scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not
954,as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him
955,the last of the spirits
956,the phantom slowly gravely silently approached
957,when it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
958,it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand
959,but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded
960,he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread
961,he knew no more for the spirit neither spoke nor moved
962,i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come said scrooge
963,the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand
964,you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued
965,is that so spirit
966,the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds as if the spirit had inclined its head
967,that was the only answer he received
968,although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it
969,the spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover
970,but scrooge was all the worse for this
971,it thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black
972,ghost of the future he exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre i have seen but as i know your purpose is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was i am prepared to bear you company and do it with a thankful heart will you not speak to me
973,it gave him no reply
974,the hand was pointed straight before them
975,lead on said scrooge
976,lead on the night is waning fast and it is precious time to me i know lead on spirit
977,the phantom moved away as it had come towards him
978,scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him along
979,they scarcely seemed to enter the city for the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act
980,but there they were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth as scrooge had seen them often
981,the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men
982,observing that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their talk
983,no said a great fat man with a monstrous chin i do not know much about it either way i only know he is dead
984,when did he die inquired another
985,last night i believe
986,why what was the matter with him asked a third taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff box
987,i thought he would never die
988,god knows said the first with a yawn
989,what has he done with his money asked a red faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills of a turkey cock
990,i have not heard said the man with the large chin yawning again
991,left it to his company perhaps he has not left it to me that is all i know
992,this pleasantry was received with a general laugh
993,it is likely to be a very cheap funeral said the same speaker for upon my life i do not know of anybody to go to it suppose we make up a party and volunteer
994,i do not mind going if a lunch is provided observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose
995,but i must be fed if i make one
996,another laugh
997,well i am the most disinterested among you after all said the first speaker for i never wear black gloves and i never eat lunch but i offer to go if anybody else will when i come to think of it i not at all sure that i was not his most particular friend for we used to stop and speak whenever we met bye bye
998,speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups
999,scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation
1000,the phantom glided on into a street
1001,its finger pointed to two persons meeting
1002,scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie here
1003,he knew these men also perfectly
1004,they were men of business very wealthy and of great importance
1005,he had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view that is strictly in a business point of view
1006,how are you said one
1007,how are you returned the other
1008,well said the first
1009,old scratch has got his own at last hey
1010,so i am told returned the second
1011,cold is not it
1012,seasonable for christmas time you are not a skater i suppose
1013,no no something else to think of good morning
1014,not another word
1015,that was their meeting their conversation and their parting
1016,scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be
1017,they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner for that was past and this ghost own province was the future
1018,nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them
1019,but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he saw and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared
1020,for he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy
1021,he looked about in that very place for his own image but another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch
1022,it gave him little surprise however for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and thought and hoped he saw his new born resolutions carried out in this
1023,quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand
1024,when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly
1025,it made him shudder and feel very cold
1026,they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute
1027,the ways were foul and narrow the shops and houses wretched the people half naked drunken slipshod ugly
1028,alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery
1029,far in this den of infamous resort there was a low browed beetling shop below a pent house roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought
1030,upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds
1031,secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones
1032,sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a charcoal stove made of old bricks was a grey haired rascal nearly seventy years of age who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement
1033,scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop
1034,but she had scarcely entered when another woman similarly laden came in too and she was closely followed by a man in faded black who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other
1035,after a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh
1036,let the charwoman alone to be the first cried she who had entered first
1037,let the laundress alone to be the second and let the undertaker own man alone to be the third look here old joe here is a chance if we have not all three met here without meaning it
1038,you could not have met in a better place said old joe removing his pipe from his mouth
1039,come into the parlour you were made free of it long ago you know and the other two ant strangers stop till i shut the door of the shop ah how it skreeks there ant such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges i believe and i sure there is no such old bones here as mine ha ha we are all suitable to our calling we are well matched come into the parlour come into the parlour
1040,the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags
1041,the old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod and having trimmed his smoky lamp for it was night with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again
1042,while he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool crossing her elbows on her knees and looking with a bold defiance at the other two
1043,what odds then what odds mrs dilber said the woman
1044,every person has a right to take care of themselves he always did
1045,that is true indeed said the laundress
1046,no man more so
1047,why then do not stand staring as if you was afraid woman who is the wiser we are not going to pick holes in each other own coats i suppose
1048,no indeed said mrs dilber and the man together
1049,we should hope not
1050,very well then cried the woman
1051,that is enough who is the worse for the loss of a few things like these not a dead man i suppose
1052,no indeed said mrs dilber laughing
1053,if he wanted to keep them after he was dead a wicked old screw pursued the woman why was not he natural in his lifetime if he had been he would have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself
1054,it is the truest word that ever was spoke said mrs dilber
1055,it is a judgment on him
1056,i wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the woman and it should have been you may depend upon it if i could have laid my hands on anything else open that bundle old joe and let me know the value of it speak out plain i not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here i believe it is no sin open the bundle joe
1057,but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder
1058,it was not extensive
1059,a seal or two a pencil case a pair of sleeve buttons and a brooch of no great value were all
1060,they were severally examined and appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come
1061,that is your account said joe and i would not give another sixpence if i was to be boiled for not doing it who is next
1062,mrs dilber was next
1063,sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two old fashioned silver teaspoons a pair of sugar tongs and a few boots
1064,her account was stated on the wall in the same manner
1065,i always give too much to ladies it is a weakness of mine and that is the way i ruin myself said old joe
1066,that is your account if you asked me for another penny and made it an open question I would repent of being so liberal and knock off half a crown
1067,and now undo my bundle joe said the first woman
1068,joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it and having unfastened a great many knots dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff
1069,what do you call this said joe
1070,bed curtains
1071,ah returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms
1072,bed curtains
1073,you do not mean to say you took them down rings and all with him lying there said joe
1074,yes i do replied the woman
1075,why not
1076,you were born to make your fortune said joe and you certainly do it
1077,i certainly shall not hold my hand when i can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such a man as he was i promise you joe returned the woman coolly
1078,do not drop that oil upon the blankets now
1079,his blankets asked joe
1080,whose else own do you think replied the woman
1081,he is not likely to take cold without them i dare say
1082,i hope he did not die of anything catching eh said old joe stopping in his work and looking up
1083,do not you be afraid of that returned the woman
1084,i ant so fond of his company that I would loiter about him for such things if he did ah you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you will not find a hole in it nor a threadbare place it is the best he had and a fine one too they would have wasted it if it had not been for me
1085,what do you call wasting of it asked old joe
1086,putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with a laugh
1087,somebody was fool enough to do it but i took it off again if calico ant good enough for such a purpose it is not good enough for anything it is quite as becoming to the body he cannot look uglier than he did in that one
1088,scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror
1089,as they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old man own lamp he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself
1090,ha ha laughed the same woman when old joe producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground
1091,this is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead ha ha ha
1092,spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot
1093,i see i see the case of this unhappy man might be my own my life tends that way now merciful heaven what is this
1094,he recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now he almost touched a bed a bare uncurtained bed on which beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up which though it was dumb announced itself in awful language
1095,the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was
1096,a pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man
1097,scrooge glanced towards the phantom
1098,its steady hand was pointed to the head
1099,the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon scrooge own part would have disclosed the face
1100,he thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side
1101,oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy dominion
1102,but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious
1103,it is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released it is not that the heart and pulse are still but that the hand was open generous and true the heart brave warm and tender and the pulse a man own
1104,strike shadow strike
1105,and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal
1106,no voice pronounced these words in scrooge own ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed
1107,he thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts
1108,avarice hard dealing griping cares
1109,they have brought him to a rich end truly
1110,he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him
1111,a cat was tearing at the door and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth stone
1112,what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think
1113,spirit he said this is a fearful place in leaving it i shall not leave its lesson trust me let us go
1114,still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head
1115,i understand you scrooge returned and i would do it if i could but i have not the power spirit i have not the power
1116,again it seemed to look upon him
1117,if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man own death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to me spirit i beseech you
1118,the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her children were
1119,she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness for she walked up and down the room started at every sound looked out from the window glanced at the clock tried but in vain to work with her needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play
1120,at length the long expected knock was heard
1121,she hurried to the door and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young
1122,there was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress
1123,he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after a long silence he appeared embarrassed how to answer
1124,is it good she said or bad to help him
1125,bad he answered
1126,we are quite ruined
1127,no there is hope yet caroline
1128,if he relents she said amazed there is nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened
1129,he is past relenting said her husband
1130,he is dead
1131,she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands
1132,she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the first was the emotion of her heart
1133,what the half drunken woman whom i told you of last night said to me when i tried to see him and obtain a week own delay and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid me turns out to have been quite true he was not only very ill but dying then
1134,to whom will our debt be transferred
1135,i do not know but before that time we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor we may sleep to night with light hearts caroline
1136,yes
1137,soften it as they would their hearts were lighter
1138,the children own faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were brighter and it was a happier house for this man own death
1139,the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure
1140,let me see some tenderness connected with a death said scrooge or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be for ever present to me
1141,the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen
1142,they entered poor bob cratchit own house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the fire
1143,quiet
1144,very quiet
1145,the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him
1146,the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing
1147,but surely they were very quiet
1148,and he took a child and set him in the midst of them
1149,where had scrooge heard those words
1150,he had not dreamed them
1151,the boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold
1152,why did he not go on
1153,the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her face
1154,the colour hurts my eyes she said
1155,the colour
1156,ah poor tiny tim
1157,they are better now again said cratchit own wife
1158,it makes them weak by candle light and i would not show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world it must be near his time
1159,past it rather peter answered shutting up his book
1160,but i think he has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings mother
1161,they were very quiet again
1162,at last she said and in a steady cheerful voice that only faltered once
1163,i have known him walk with i have known him walk with tiny tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed
1164,and so have i cried peter
1165,often
1166,and so have i exclaimed another
1167,so had all
1168,but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon her work and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble and there is your father at the door
1169,she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforter he had need of it poor fellow came in
1170,his tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most
1171,then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said do not mind it father do not be grieved
1172,bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family
1173,he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of mrs cratchit and the girls
1174,they would be done long before sunday he said
1175,sunday you went to day then robert said his wife
1176,yes my dear returned bob
1177,i wish you could have gone it would have done you good to see how green a place it is but you see it often i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday my little little child cried bob
1178,my little child
1179,he broke down all at once
1180,he could not help it
1181,if he could have helped it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were
1182,he left the room and went up stairs into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas
1183,there was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately
1184,poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face
1185,he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy
1186,they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working still
1187,bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooge own nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a little just a little down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him
1188,on which said bob for he is the pleasantest spoken gentleman you ever heard i told him i am heartily sorry for it mr cratchit he said and heartily sorry for your good wife by the bye how he ever knew that i do not know
1189,knew what my dear
1190,why that you were a good wife replied bob
1191,everybody knows that said peter
1192,very well observed my boy cried bob
1193,i hope they do heartily sorry he said for your good wife if i can be of service to you in any way he said giving me his card that is where i live pray come to me now it was not cried bob for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt with us
1194,i sure he is a good soul said mrs cratchit
1195,you would be surer of it my dear returned bob if you saw and spoke to him i should not be at all surprised mark what i say if he got peter a better situation
1196,only hear that peter said mrs cratchit
1197,and then cried one of the girls peter will be keeping company with some one and setting up for himself
1198,get along with you retorted peter grinning
1199,it is just as likely as not said bob one of these days though there is plenty of time for that my dear but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny tim shall we or this first parting that there was among us
1200,never father cried they all
1201,and i know said bob i know my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was although he was a little little child we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor tiny tim in doing it
1202,no never father they all cried again
1203,i am very happy said little bob i am very happy
1204,mrs cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands
1205,spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from god
1206,spectre said scrooge something informs me that our parting moment is at hand i know it but i know not how tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead
1207,the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as before though at a different time he thought indeed there seemed no order in these latter visions save that they were in the future into the resorts of business men but showed him not himself
1208,indeed the spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment
1209,this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time i see the house let me behold what i shall be in days to come
1210,the spirit stopped the hand was pointed elsewhere
1211,the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed
1212,why do you point away
1213,the inexorable finger underwent no change
1214,scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in
1215,it was an office still but not his
1216,the furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself
1217,the phantom pointed as before
1218,he joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone accompanied it until they reached an iron gate
1219,he paused to look round before entering
1220,a churchyard
1221,here then the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground
1222,it was a worthy place
1223,walled in by houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetation own death not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite
1224,a worthy place
1225,the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one
1226,he advanced towards it trembling
1227,the phantom was exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape
1228,before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer me one question are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of things that may be only
1229,still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood
1230,men own courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge
1231,but if the courses be departed from the ends will change say it is thus with what you show me
1232,the spirit was immovable as ever
1233,scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went and following the finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name ebenezer scrooge
1234,am i that man who lay upon the bed he cried upon his knees
1235,the finger pointed from the grave to him and back again
1236,no spirit oh no no
1237,the finger still was there
1238,spirit he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me i am not the man i was i will not be the man i must have been but for this intercourse why show me this if i am past all hope
1239,for the first time the hand appeared to shake
1240,good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it your nature intercedes for me and pities me assure me that i yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life
1241,the kind hand trembled
1242,i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year i will live in the past the present and the future the spirits of all three shall strive within me i will not shut out the lessons that they teach oh tell me i may sponge away the writing on this stone
1243,in his agony he caught the spectral hand
1244,it sought to free itself but he was strong in his entreaty and detained it
1245,the spirit stronger yet repulsed him
1246,holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw an alteration in the phantom own hood and dress
1247,it shrunk collapsed and dwindled down into a bedpost
1248,the end of it
1249,yes and the bedpost was his own
1250,the bed was his own the room was his own
1251,best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make amends in
1252,i will live in the past the present and the future
1253,scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed
1254,the spirits of all three shall strive within me oh jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised for this i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees
1255,he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call
1256,he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with tears
1257,they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bed curtains in his arms they are not torn down rings and all they are here i am here the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled they will be i know they will
1258,his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance
1259,i do not know what to do cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laocoon of himself with his stockings
1260,i am as light as a feather i am as happy as an angel i am as merry as a schoolboy i am as giddy as a drunken man a merry christmas to everybody a happy new year to all the world hallo here whoop hallo
1261,he had frisked into the sitting room and was now standing there perfectly winded
1262,there is the saucepan that the gruel was in cried scrooge starting off again and going round the fireplace
1263,there is the door by which the ghost of jacob marley entered there is the corner where the ghost of christmas present sat there is the window where i saw the wandering spirits it is all right it is all true it all happened ha ha ha
1264,really for a man who had been out of practice for so many years it was a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh
1265,the father of a long long line of brilliant laughs
1266,i do not know what day of the month it is said scrooge
1267,i do not know how long I have been among the spirits i do not know anything i quite a baby never mind i do not care I would rather be a baby hallo whoop hallo here
1268,he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard
1269,clash clang hammer ding dong bell
1270,bell dong ding hammer clang clash
1271,oh glorious glorious
1272,running to the window he opened it and put out his head
1273,no fog no mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells
1274,oh glorious
1275,glorious
1276,what is to day cried scrooge calling downward to a boy in sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him
1277,eh returned the boy with all his might of wonder
1278,what is to day my fine fellow said scrooge
1279,to day replied the boy
1280,why christmas day
1281,it is christmas day said scrooge to himself
1282,i have not missed it the spirits have done it all in one night they can do anything they like of course they can of course they can hallo my fine fellow
1283,hallo returned the boy
1284,do you know the poulterer own in the next street but one at the corner
1285,scrooge inquired
1286,i should hope i did replied the lad
1287,an intelligent boy said scrooge
1288,a remarkable boy do you know whether they have sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there not the little prize turkey the big one
1289,what the one as big as me returned the boy
1290,what a delightful boy said scrooge
1291,it is a pleasure to talk to him yes my buck
1292,it is hanging there now replied the boy
1293,is it said scrooge
1294,go and buy it
1295,walk er exclaimed the boy
1296,no no said scrooge i am in earnest go and buy it and tell them to bring it here that i may give them the direction where to take it come back with the man and i give you a shilling come back with him in less than five minutes and i give you half a crown
1297,the boy was off like a shot
1298,he must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast
1299,i send it to bob cratchit own whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh
1300,he shall not know who sends it it is twice the size of tiny tim joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob own will be
1301,the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write it he did somehow and went down stairs to open the street door ready for the coming of the poulterer own man
1302,as he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye
1303,i shall love it as long as i live cried scrooge patting it with his hand
1304,i scarcely ever looked at it before what an honest expression it has in its face it is a wonderful knocker here is the turkey hallo whoop how are you merry christmas
1305,it was a turkey
1306,he never could have stood upon his legs that bird
1307,he would have snapped them short off in a minute like sticks of sealing wax
1308,why it is impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge
1309,you must have a cab
1310,the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and chuckled till he cried
1311,shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very much and shaving requires attention even when you do not dance while you are at it
1312,but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a piece of sticking plaister over it and been quite satisfied
1313,he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets
1314,the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile
1315,he looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four good humoured fellows said good morning sir a merry christmas to you
1316,and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears
1317,he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his counting house the day before and said scrooge and marley own i believe
1318,it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it
1319,my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands
1320,how do you do i hope you succeeded yesterday it was very kind of you a merry christmas to you sir
1321,mr scrooge
1322,yes said scrooge
1323,that is my name and i fear it may not be pleasant to you allow me to ask your pardon and will you have the goodness here scrooge whispered in his ear
1324,lord bless me cried the gentleman as if his breath were taken away
1325,my dear mr scrooge are you serious
1326,if you please said scrooge
1327,not a farthing less a great many back payments are included in it i assure you will you do me that favour
1328,my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him
1329,i do not know what to say to such munifi
1330,do not say anything please retorted scrooge
1331,come and see me will you come and see me
1332,i will cried the old gentleman
1333,and it was clear he meant to do it
1334,thankee said scrooge
1335,i am much obliged to you i thank you fifty times bless you
1336,he went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure
1337,he had never dreamed that any walk that anything could give him so much happiness
1338,in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew own house
1339,he passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock
1340,but he made a dash and did it
1341,is your master at home my dear said scrooge to the girl
1342,nice girl
1343,very
1344,yes sir
1345,where is he my love said scrooge
1346,he is in the dining room sir along with mistress i show you up stairs if you please
1347,thankee he knows me said scrooge with his hand already on the dining room lock
1348,i go in here my dear
1349,he turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door
1350,they were looking at the table which was spread out in great array for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right
1351,fred said scrooge
1352,dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started
1353,scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he would not have done it on any account
1354,why bless my soul cried fred who is that
1355,it is i your uncle scrooge i have come to dinner will you let me in fred
1356,let him in
1357,it is a mercy he did not shake his arm off
1358,he was at home in five minutes
1359,nothing could be heartier
1360,his niece looked just the same
1361,so did topper when he came
1362,so did the plump sister when she came
1363,so did every one when they came
1364,wonderful party wonderful games wonderful unanimity won der ful happiness
1365,but he was early at the office next morning
1366,oh he was early there
1367,if he could only be there first and catch bob cratchit coming late
1368,that was the thing he had set his heart upon
1369,and he did it yes he did
1370,the clock struck nine
1371,no bob
1372,a quarter past
1373,no bob
1374,he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time
1375,scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank
1376,his hat was off before he opened the door his comforter too
1377,he was on his stool in a jiffy driving away with his pen as if he were trying to overtake nine of the clock
1378,hallo growled scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it
1379,what do you mean by coming here at this time of day
1380,i am very sorry sir said bob
1381,i am behind my time
1382,you are repeated scrooge
1383,yes i think you are step this way sir if you please
1384,it is only once a year sir pleaded bob appearing from the tank
1385,it shall not be repeated i was making rather merry yesterday sir
1386,now i tell you what my friend said scrooge i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer and therefore he continued leaping from his stool and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank again and therefore i am about to raise your salary
1387,bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler
1388,he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait waistcoat
1389,a merry christmas bob said scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back
1390,a merrier christmas bob my good fellow than i have given you for many a year i raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of smoking bishop bob make up the fires and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another i bob cratchit
1391,scrooge was better than his word
1392,he did it all and infinitely more and to tiny tim who did not die he was a second father
1393,he became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world
1394,some people laughed to see the alteration in him but he let them laugh and little heeded them for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe for good at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less attractive forms
1395,his own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him
1396,he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the total abstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge
1397,may that be truly said of us and all of us
1398,and so as tiny tim observed god bless us every one
