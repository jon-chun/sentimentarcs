79,79,0,"Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a
lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so
little business to be, that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough
now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but
Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew
its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.
The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway

Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was
white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were
very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold
were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately
formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic
of the purest white; and round its waist was bound
a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held
a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular
contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed
with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,
that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was
doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a
great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.",it was a strange figure like a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a child own proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm,1126,211,7.1000000000000005,3.2964224488125047,4.4375,3.2964224488125047,0.5192346367693693,7.1000000000000005,3.4455912092138763,4.472440944881891,3.4455912092138763,0.5933353448732893,110.04053606802611,2.65637264501569,2.580667437893859,2.65637264501569,0.6023792096316173,3.961904761904762,3.269423638944846,4.151457541191383,3.269423638944846,0.4054906816110843,3.9160000000000004,1.0525906203956121,1.4886070002349074,1.0525906203956121,-0.15093765571680673,52.07895217212372,2.8637982386486462,6.046073617868953,2.8637982386486462,0.6831201026629815,3.479030131238527,2.768586725926974,3.397791200506298,2.768586725926974,0.53584817843115,"{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9734}",0.9734,1.6221966810610016,1.1289723961957783,1.6221966810610016,0.21278189693274102,0.1911352657004831,0.4024961533806391,0.805195732501889,0.4024961533806391,0.15782250567769143,0.8584733373002227,2.7385632802255078,3.4978847341051447,2.7385632802255078,0.6019257952156767,39.917293084736784,3.6048470373631494,3.6584473209189885,3.6048470373631494,-0.7014309213866325,0.5534,0.9334345585359629,0.7557539369041977,0.9334345585359629,0.2965129379281225

247,247,1,"A terrible voice in the hall cried, ""Bring down Master
Scrooge's box, there!"" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster
himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious
condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind
by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his
sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that
ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial
and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.
Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a
block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments
of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,
sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of ""something""
to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,
but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had
rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied
on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster
good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove

310,310,1,"They were in another scene and place; a room, not very
large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter
fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge
believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely
matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this
room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children
there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;
and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not
forty children conducting themselves like one, but every
child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences
were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;
on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,
and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to
mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands
most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of
them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I
wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little
shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to
save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they
did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should
have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,
and never come straight again. And yet I should
have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have
questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have
looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never
raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of
which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should
have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence
of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its
value.",they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude no no i would not for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i would not have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i could not have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value,1752,325,10.4,4.891442640389144,6.5,4.891442640389144,0.493784826403772,11.4,5.630766919388927,7.181102362204725,5.630766919388927,0.6185087057673716,88.3260412226264,2.128290340670591,2.071419738998654,2.128290340670591,0.3139099899385419,-6.01875,-5.169581023393463,-6.474334600760458,-5.169581023393463,-0.554967526799244,23.921999999999997,8.914900152044133,10.887714352830631,8.914900152044133,0.5531319819225251,75.9829649841464,4.28205286885249,8.82119514386102,4.28205286885249,0.647068351805018,4.412004065799055,3.554330414489151,4.308979234403253,3.554330414489151,0.4411827941617445,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.688, 'pos': 0.201, 'compound': 0.9917}",0.9917,1.6570317241152899,1.1501971700301554,1.6570317241152899,0.1407416836045267,0.1868839176696319,0.3844664245432515,0.7867637213321386,0.3844664245432515,0.0965612393237622,1.2368815411306673,4.155994284479463,5.087068541743372,4.155994284479463,0.558731123553158,55.998513142834156,5.555260329209932,5.502677863920821,5.555260329209932,-0.8011179277743935,0.6648,1.0594935873495208,0.8144256596618739,1.0594935873495208,0.2879311641066543

swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!

and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a
perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming
berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and
ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had
been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring
up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had
never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and
many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form
a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,
great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,
mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,

385,385,2,"Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose
the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a
black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was
something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made
the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;
Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;
Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted
the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for
everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard
upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was
said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.
Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the
long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of

443,443,2,"But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After
a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children
sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its
mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first
a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I
no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he
had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done
thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the
Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,
tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,
smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,
there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.
He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up
against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would
have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would
have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly
have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.
She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.
But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her
silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got
her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his
conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to
know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her
head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by
pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain
about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told

wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill
of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these
would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in
